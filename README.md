DataPlot
--------

An interactive data visualization dashboard created using JavaScript, Highcharts, jQuery, Bootstrap, Underscore.js and other libraries.

DataPlot interactively modifies plots based on user selection, calculates selected data means, and uses linear regression to draw best-fit trend lines.

PapaParse.js is used to parse CSV data to JSON format. Moment.js is utilized for converting string-encoded date and time data to Date objects. Highcharts and jQuery are extensively used to render interactive charts. Underscore.js and Sugar.js provide syntactic sweetness. Simple Statistics is used for calculating means and performing linear regression. Finally, Bootstrap is used for user interface enhancement.

###Future development roadmap:
* Create a set of tests using Jasmine.
* Refactor code in order to increase readibilty and DRYness. Continously test with Jasmine in order to ensure that refactoring does not break code.
* Update application to introduce new features and improve user experience.
