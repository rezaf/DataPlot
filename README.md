# DataPlot
An interactive data visualization tool created using JavaScript, Highcharts, jQuery, Bootstrap, Moment.js, PapaParse.js, Simple Statistics and Underscore.js, with a dash of Sugar.js added for syntactic sweetness.

DataPlot interactively modifies plots based on user selection, calculates selected data means and uses linear regression to draw best-fit trend lines.
